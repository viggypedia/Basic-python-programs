#Question 4:
#AIM:Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and a function to calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. The class has three constructors which are :
#1 - having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.
#2 - having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth respectively.
#3 - having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number.
#Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their areas.

class rectangle: 
    length=0 
    breadth=0 
    def __init__(self, *args): 
        if len(args) == 2:
            self.length=args[0]; 
            self.breadth=args[1] 
        elif len(args) == 1: 
            self.length=args[0] 
            self.breadth=args[0] 
        else: 
            self.length=0 
            self.breadth=0 
    def area(self): 
        return self.length*self.breadth; 



r1=rectangle(5,10) 

print(r1.area()) 



r2=rectangle(10) 

print(r2.area()) 

 

r3=rectangle() 

print(r3.area())
